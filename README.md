# Gold Price Forecasting Using Time-Series Simulation

## Overview
This project explores historical gold prices to understand how prices behave over time and what future price ranges might look like.
Instead of predicting one exact future price, the focus is on showing **a range of possible outcomes**, which is more realistic for financial data.

## What Was Done
- Cleaned and prepared daily gold price data
- Visualized long-term trends and short-term fluctuations
- Modeled price changes and volatility patterns
- Simulated thousands of possible future price paths
- Summarized results using clear visual bands

## Why This Matters
Financial markets are uncertain.
This approach helps:
- Visualize risk
- Understand possible future scenarios
- Avoid overconfidence in single-point forecasts

## Key Output
The final chart shows:
- A central estimate (median path)
- Shaded bands representing likely price ranges
- Increasing uncertainty over time

## Tools Used
- R
- ggplot2
- Time-series analysis
- Simulation-based forecasting
